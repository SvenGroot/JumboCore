# Quick Start guide

This guide helps you to get Jumbo running on your system. This document assumes you have some
knowledge about systems like Hadoop; it is not a full introduction to distributed data processing in
general.

It will help you configure Jumbo for local testing (on a single node) or on a cluster, and walk you
through uploading some data and running your first data processing job.
