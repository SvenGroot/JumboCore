    ///   The <see cref="IWritable"/> interface provides a simple, light-weight serialization protocol that
    ///   is used primarily by the <see cref="BinaryRecordReader{T}"/> and <see cref="BinaryRecordWriter{T}"/>
    ///   class (but is also used in a few other instances).

    /// <para>
    ///   Unlike the serialization provided by the <see cref="System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter"/>
    ///   class, <see cref="IWritable"/> serialization is done entirely by the class that implements the
    ///   interface. There are no built-in checks to see if the type being deserialized from a stream
    ///   matches the type that was serialized to it. It is up to the implementation of the <see cref="Write"/>
    ///   and <see cref="Read"/> methods to guarantee binary compatibility.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    ///   For this reason, it is recommended to use <see cref="IWritable"/> serialization only for
    ///   short-time storage where the performance of serializing and deserializing is important.
    ///   Its primary usage in Jumbo (intermediate data for Jumbo Jet jobs) fits these criteria.
    /// </para>

    ///   Types that implement <see cref="IWritable"/> must be reference types (classes). To
    ///   support serialization of value types, you must implement a <see cref="IValueWriter{T}"/>
    ///   for those types and mark them with the <see cref="ValueWriterAttribute"/>.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    ///   The <see cref="BinaryRecordReader{T}"/> creates new record instances by using the <see cref="System.Runtime.Serialization.FormatterServices.GetUninitializedObject"/>
    ///   method. This means the object's constructors are not invoked, so the <see cref="Read"/> implementation may not make any
    ///   assumptions about the state of the class, and must guarantee the object is in a consistent state after
    ///   it finishes.

    ///   When record reuse is enabled, the <see cref="Read"/> method will be called multiple times on
    ///   the same instance. The <see cref="Read"/> method must replace the entire internal state
