    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    ///   Normally, classes support this protocol by implementing the <see cref="IWritable"/>
    ///   interface. However, the <see cref="IWritable"/> interface cannot be used on value types
    ///   (structs) because of the semantics of calling interface methods that modify the object's
    ///   state on a value type.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    ///   To provide serialization support for a value type, you must create a class implementing
    ///   <see cref="IValueWriter{T}"/> for that value type, and mark the value type with the
    ///   <see cref="ValueWriterAttribute"/>. Although you can use <see cref="IValueWriter{T}"/>
    ///   for reference types as well, this is not recommended because <see cref="IValueWriter{T}"/>
    ///   doesn't support record reuse.
